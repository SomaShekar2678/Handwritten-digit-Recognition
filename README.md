# Handwritten-digit-Recognition

This repository contains a project for recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This project aims to accurately classify handwritten digit images using a Neural Network.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- NN model for digit classification
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
